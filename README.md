# Friend Finder

In this application, I have built a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application. This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

I used Express to handle routing. Making sure I deployed the app to Heroku so other users can fill it out.

In this application I used the npm packages; express, body-parser and path.

Converting each user's results into a simple array of numbers. I am able to compare the difference between the current user's scores against those from other users, question by question. Adding up the differences to calculate the total difference.

The closest match will be the user with the least amount of difference.

Displaying the closest match of the survey results.

The Application is deployed on Heroku:
